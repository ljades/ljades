COMP116 Final Project - Android Fragmentation: Protecting the Gene Pool By
Better Knowing it

1. The paper itself is the file "KnowTheGenePool.pdf"
2. In the repository is the test application I pushed to my device, samples of
	recorded output from logcat (adb) and ps (shell), and the Android
	Cluster Toolkit as I worked with it and configured it.
3. All direct code examples are within the paper as images representing the Terminal
	work I did.
