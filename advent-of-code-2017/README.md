## Advent of Code 2017

This folder contains all of my work on the Advent of Code 2017 coding challenges. The original challenges can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2017).

All solutions are in Python. For each problem, I created a class that would solve the problem, 
At the bottom of the class file, I'd drop the problem's input and a quick instance of the class that would
output the solution given the input.

Current Version - 0.8:
- Not all Advent of Code challenges are finished yet (still working on them--started late)
- All completed challenges follow Google Python coding standards to the best of my ability given self-imposed time constraints.
- Documentation is incomplete
- Code solutions are not in separate, more organized and labeled folders
- Code is not always as compact as could be. As I mentioned, these were the results of self-imposed time constraints.
- Some solutions are still completely built to solve Parts 1 and 2 of each day's coding challenge. Some originally would solve Part 1 but then were retrofitted to solve Part 2 right afterwards. As a result, currently, these may have the functionality to solve Part 1 partially gutted.

Future plans:
- Update with final coding challenges
- Expand on documentation
- Clean up code where optimal
- Organize solutions in organized and labeled folders
- Re-introduce class methods solely dedicated to Part 1 where necessary
