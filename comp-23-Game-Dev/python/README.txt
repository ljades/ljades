LAB 2 - README

1. All aspects of the lab are fully functional: ip_addresses.py, reverselist.py, and word_count.py
	a. I chose to count the number of words for word_count as the total number of words seen, not just the total number 
		of unique ones.

2. There was no collaboration involved in Lab 2 for me.

3. Hours spent working on it: approximately 1.5 hours. 0.5 hours learning the Python functionality and syntax,
	1.0 hours spent coding and thinking of the programs.
