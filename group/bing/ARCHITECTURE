There are 3 javascript files:
1) index.js
2) jroute.js
3) jstop.js

From the bottom up:
3) jstop represents one stop and all the associated data. it handles pegging its displays to the given map
2) jroute represents a whole route. it exports functions for manipulating the route, and it also responds to 
	changes as the user drags the route. Jroute uses jstop.
1) index.js handles some init code, and then right now just displays a static route. eventually that route
	will come from the db. index uses jroute and a teeny bit of jstop.

And thats the relationship between the files!
