DATABASE

We're using MongoDB in the background. If you git pull the latest version, run 'node server.js' to start it on your local machine.
It's currently running on port 9898 although that may change.

It depends on MongooseJS, ExpressJS, and the util library.

Schema:
We define a route, as follows:

{
	path:[{
		lat:Number,
		lon:Number,
		isStop:Boolean,
		name:String
	}],
	id:Number
}

The path data field is an array of json objects that correspond to a point in the route. id is the unique id we assign to that route.

Different urls to make requests to:

GET:

50.63.172.74:9898/joey/bing - gets the default route for the joey
