The security assessment is complete, but some of it is based on hypotheticals and
simply what I can derive from looking at the code and pages. Some of his functions
don't work so well from when I tried to operate them by normal means.

The assignment took perhaps 5 hours in total.

I collaborated with no one (I mean, except for actually receiving the stuff from my partner
and giving my stuff to him).
