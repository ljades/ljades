comp20-lades - Spring 2013 Web Programming Projects Repository

Favorite Project - Frogger Fully Animated. It was my favorite to work on because I
	could continuously test the program and watch as new features would be added on the
	fly. There was a strong sense of accomplishment in seeing the program slowly evolve
	into something I could play.

Project I am most proud of - Where in the World is... Plenty of real-life applications,
	working with APIs that are used all too frequently in web development, learning how
	to actually use third-party APIs. I felt that the most practical lessons were able
	to be taken out of it.

I learned a completely new language of a completely different style than most OOP
	languages. I learned how to publish projects for just about anyone to see with ease.
	I obtained skills that can be directly applied to the workforce, were I to take
	any job in web design or web development. I learned the importance of security and
	how any holes can be used to completely destroy my programs, and then how to prevent
	that from happening. I learned that sometimes, it's not about conceptualizing, but
	about using every resource available to oneself until the answer is found. It isn't
	a simple building concept like C++ is, where you keep learning how to do new things
	with the same stuff. There's a lot of new things to keep track of and the only way
	to do so is to use the internet to one's advantage.
