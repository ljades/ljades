This assignment took approximately 55 minutes.

Everything works as expected.

The only help I received was from you, where I didn't realize I couldn't put the onload
attribute inside the div tag, but I had to put it in the body tag.

UPDATE: LAB 8: This assignment took approximately an hour. We have the error of the
cross origin thing, but you said that that's fine.
