This assignment took approximately 2.5 hours of work.

Everything works as planned, and there are no errors. The only issue is that when the page first loads, some things don't render.
Only after a refresh does the rest render as planned.

Not everything is ready for animation, but I wrote it all so that it can be easily
tinkered with when the time comes for animation.

I received no help on this project.

UPDATE FOR ASSIGNMENT 4: Everything works as planned. I received no help on this 
assignment, save for some online resources to work with Math objects. This took perhaps
12-14 hours of work in total, more or less (hard to keep track past 10).

	The additional features I implemented were:
	1. I implemented the timer, but not taking the lady frog home.
	2. I animated Frogger to dead_frog.png when he died.
	4. I implemented level progression. After the first level, more cars are added,
		and after the second level some logs are removed. After every level, the logs
		and cars speed up.
	6. I incorporated a fly to come in at random times and stay there for a set period
		of time.
