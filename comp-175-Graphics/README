COMP175 -Graphics Programming

Currently, this repository only contains one directory, containing my
final project for the class, which was utlizing a recursive ray tracer
to build a model for lightning simulation. The project was also slightly
expanded upon to include another model for continuously branching off
metalic spheres that would continuously split off.
