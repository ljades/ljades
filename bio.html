<title>Louis's Biography</title>

<body>
<h2 class="bio">He is...the most interesting man in the world</h2>
<p class="bio">You may think you know Louis Ades, but do you REALLY know him?</p>
<p class="bio">Louis was born in 1994. He first learned the art of the lightsaber (toy) at age
4. He later learned to actually fence for about a year. He's more of a math and
science guy than anything, and he's always looking forward to what awaits us in the
future.</p>
<p class="bio">At age 7, he began to learn how to play piano, but after a year, he stopped when
parents didn't want to pay for lessons anymore. He resumed playing at age 12 and has
been playing ever since. At around this time, he also learned his first bits of C++
programming language. He would continue to learn C++ in college until he finally
built a Connect 4 AI that has been able to beat every player it's been faced with
as of yet. At age 17, he began to study Tai Chi, the Chinese martial art mostly
known for its meditative and soothing properties but also well-renowned for its
martial properties. He has been studying ever since.</p>
<p class="bio">In college, Louis hopes to become extremely proficient with computer science.
He has already become a member of a famous Jewish A Cappella group, and has also
become very engrossed in campus life. Let's see if his goals will be reached.</p>
