Louis Jack Ades's Project Repo

Currently still a work in progress. As, I guess, it always should be!

Note: Most of the projects I worked on in my classes are not included
in this repository as including answers in a public repository would be
dangerous for current students taking those classes. The projects included
are selective, in that they are either personally designed projects, or do
not give away answers of current revisions of these projects in classes as
they are currently taught (as given permission by those professors). I'm
working on adding new things as I regain access to them and or get permission
to post them.
