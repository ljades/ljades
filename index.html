Shapes With Borders!
</a>
<div style="width:70%">
Shapes with Borders is a simple game with a simple title: There are shapes that have white borders. Two fingers must be kept on the white borders for as long as the shape is shaded purple. When it lights up green, the player must take his fingers off of the shape until the next one appears. The player repeats until he keeps his fingers out of the borders for too long and loses. The catch is that these shapes are moving in wild patterns, and keeping track of them becomes tricky. Try to beat your high score each time!
